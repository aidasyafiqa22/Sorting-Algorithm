# SortingAlgorithm

A fundamental building block of many other algorithms is sorting. It has connections to a number of fascinating concepts that you will encounter in your career as a programmer. Implementing accurate and effective sorting algorithms that address real-world issues requires a fundamental understanding of how Python sorting algorithms operate behind the scenes. In computer science, sorting is one of the most extensively researched algorithms. You can use a plethora of sorting implementations and applications to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of your code.

In this program, I have designed two simplest sorting algorithm codes using Python which are Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort.
Bubble Sort is one of the most straightforward sorting algorithms. Its name comes from the way the algorithm works: With every new pass, the largest element in the list “bubbles up” toward its correct position.
Like bubble sort, the insertion sort algorithm is straightforward to implement and understand. But unlike bubble sort, it builds the sorted list one element at a time by comparing each item with the rest of the list and inserting it into its correct position. This “insertion” procedure gives the algorithm its name.

Program Structure
- From the main file, user will get to choose if the numbers they wish to sort is by using a given list of default numbers or using their own input numbers
- Once decision is made, program will then prompt user the type of sorting algorithm users would like to use to sort the numbers
- Program will print out both unsorted list of numbers and the outcome of the list of sorted numbers
